# 1.INTRODUCTION
## 1.1.  Purpose

The portfolio website is to give a prospective employer a sense of who you are, what you can do and whether you are the person they should hire to execute their project. Just as it's important to always keep our résumé/CV updated regularly, we should keep a well-maintained portfolio website that shows and tells all your latest accomplishments. Not only does a programmer portfolio website act as a showcase for your previous work samples, but the site itself is an example of what you can do.
